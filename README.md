# Drum-Kit
A website that plays the sounds of different drums when clicked on its picture or pressed its respective buttons. See --> https://mevinmoncy.github.io/Drum-Kit/

Why I created this project?
I created this project to practice building applications using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was a fun way to lear about interative ways the users can interact with the websites, either by pressing a button or clicking it.
