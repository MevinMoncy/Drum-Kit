## Why I Created This Project

I developed this project as a way to enhance my skills in web development, specifically using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Building this interactive drum kit provided a hands-on experience in creating user-friendly interfaces and enabling various forms of user interaction.

## Features

- **Interactive Drum Sounds:** Experience the thrill of playing drums without needing physical instruments. Each drum element responds to both mouse clicks and keyboard presses.

- **Easy-to-Use Interface:** The intuitive design allows users to explore and experiment with different drum sounds effortlessly.

- **Visual Feedback:** When a drum is played, the corresponding button briefly animates, providing immediate visual feedback to the user.

## How to Use

1. **Mouse Interaction:** Click on the drum images/buttons to produce the corresponding drum sounds.

2. **Keyboard Interaction:** Alternatively, use your keyboard to trigger sounds:
   - `w`: Tom 1 sound
   - `a`: Tom 2 sound
   - `s`: Tom 3 sound
   - `d`: Tom 4 sound
   - `j`: Snare sound
   - `k`: Crash sound
   - `l`: Kick sound

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: Defines the structure of the webpage.
- `styles.css`: Contains styling rules for layout and appearance.
